# Project Express API

First week with backend where I created my first API with RESTful endpoints.

## The problem

The project was to create endpoints that either could return an array of data or a single item. I did go with on of the JSON file that was provided in the project. I used both path params to create endpoints that can return a single title or id. But I also used query params to filter out directors and titles.
